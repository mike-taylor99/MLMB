# MLMB: **M**achine **L**earning on (NCAA) **M**en's **B**asketball

## What is MLMB?
Project MLMB is a webservice which will allow user's to make predictions on NCAA Men's Basketball matchups. User's will be able to specify two NCAA men's basketball teams, as well as the type of machine learning model (Logistic Regression, Random Forest Regression, Neural Network, etc.), and have a calculated prediction returned based on the chosen model.
